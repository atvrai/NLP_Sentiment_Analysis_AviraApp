Review,Sentiment
This app does not mess about. Very accurate and interface friendly. I am at a point that now I cannot do without this kind of interface integration to save 30 odd passwords I have. Any time I need to change a password or get a new one generated this does it seamlessly. Make this one stay please. All my fingers are thumbs up !!,
"great when it works, but finicky and frustrating. edit: its finicky and frustrating because the password manager doesn't recognize a lot of fields where i need to put a password in or suggest a strong password and it wont save said strong password, so i have to go into the app instead of just signing in. the mobile version regularly just signs me out every thirty seconds sometimes.",
"I would look somewhere else to store passwords. * passwords dont update across devices * i cant login in this app on android , it keeps saying there is no mobile data, which is absurd. I am also using wifi , same thing. * On the iPhone version, you can log in, but all passwords are blank * On desktop, it's ok. I think It was good before , somewhere you guys are dropping the ball.this app was actually good, and I recommend this like to everyone.",
"Appalling technical support. I got a new device and logged out of my old one. Tried logging into PWM on new device keep getting the error ""no internet connection"". Tried to log into PWM on my old device, to see if that worked. Nope, get the same error. Go through all the usual troubleshooting steps, uninstall, restart device etc etc. Nothing works. So I opened a ticket. Explained the problem and told them all the steps I'd tried. Only to get a generic response asking me to try the same steps",
"Worked fine for a while but for some reason, whenever I type in my master password, it now doesn't let me log in and shows me an error, saying that there's no internet connection even though the internet works just fine for every other app on my phone.",
"I don't know why but often it just doesn't pop up with username and password to fill in my apps and website passwords. And one thing I would truly like to see in this app is to unlock it with a pattern or pincode. But generally otherwise I like the ease of use and the fact that you can also write notes for the particular websites and apps. And I like Avira, having used their products for many years.",
Excellent password manager! Had a problem with a button constantly on screen. Turned out to be an Android accessibility setting. All is great now!,
"Does everything it promises, across platforms, and free of charge, excellent, what more would you need?... actually, password sharing would be very useful 😉",
"This has been my favorite password management tool. However, I was recently forced to relogin and can't get an verification code anymore. I am from Philippines, pls advise.",
"Hi team, Recently facing issue as not able to login into account. Tried clearing cache,re login into account. It just says preparing password. Please assist",
The most important thing about an app like these is that is has to work and remember password...after a update it says hey 0 password safed ....what a huge Shi. . Spending now half a day to make everywhere new passwords . Then better write them again on a piece of paper,
"Needs an auto generator built into the Android app. Also randomly forgets it's logged in and shows a blank list when I tap on the pop-up from my browser. Then when I open the app, it's still logged in, so it wasn't a security timeout.",
"The app was great before but now I suddenly can't even log in with my master password it keeps saying ""incorrect password"" even tho it is correct",
"App is not working anymore, saying there is no internet connection while every other app has connected fine.",
Full featured and convenient. Works well and does exactly what I need.,
I used to be a ironvst user but I started using APM because its much better than ironvest.. however its such a shame that I dont know about Avira password manager sooner. Been using Avira service for antivirus since 2008. . Thank you for this app.. The perk using this app is they APM may tell you if your account have been breached and advice you to change your password.,
Doesn't open when you put master password. No error indicating the problem whether the password is wrong or not.,
"App was great until a few weeks ago it started CONSTANTLY freezing after logging in. And nothing helps - I tried re-installing it, restarting my phone. It was a little annoying at first, but now it happens half of the times I try to use it. And auto-fill function doesn't work properly - it either doesn't show up at all for some websites or offers to ""save my password"" when I set my alarm clock.",
"This app is ok, but it requires a password prior to opening. That's better than trying to remember so many different passwords, but much less convenient than if it just opened whenever you need it. Also, it does not open for every site and is often unable to follow when a new password is needed. The PC version is a bit better than the android version. But, they both need improvement",
"I think the best password manager out there. Has 2-way verification that no one else has. also includes a two way verification app so you have 2 apps in one and syncs it on all devices, thats the best. Informs you when a account has been breached (only pro version). The only think that I would like to have is clear the clipboard after a few seconds or minutes. Update Apr 2019: The autofill function is nit working for me. I don't know why. Also the clipboard is not working.",
"Good application. Very useful but sometimes, the fingerprint unlock is not available and I have to use my master password which is quite long and complicated. It is also very difficult to see the difference between the lowercase l and the number 1 when you want to see a password. Autofill feature is annoying take too much space on the screen.",
"App started out great. Everything that I needed. But after a while passwords would not update across multiple devices. And then when I open the app absolutely no passwords come up, meaning the entire password databases blank. Inexplicable errors that make the entire system unusable unfortunately. I'll probably give it another week to see if the developers fix these issues then I'll simply move to another system. I would be willing to pay for a quality app",
"I've subscribed for AVIRA PRIME and loved it very much. What captivates me is the Avira Password Manager, where I don't have to remember or write down all the passwords which redious and troublesome. TQ keep it up.",
Best Password Manager I have ever used. Also includes 2FA support all in one app.,
The app cannot even reinstall after uninstall. Useless.,
the new update seems to break the app...can't login with all my phones with the latest update.,
An error has occurred. Please try again later. This is all I get when trying to log in. Update: working now. It appears that the above message is after too many attempts....maybe,
"Terrible I assumed my passwords were downloaded into my Avira Acct. Not a single p/w was saved. Also,feedback feature not showing how to be in touch with Avira support. No password create site Disappointing!",
Correction : so i tried it on my personal computer and all is fine. Thank you for and awesome tool and for your swift response! It's back to 6 ⭐!!,
Works great! I still have a problem with it recognizing some apps and websites without entering my Master Passcode but once I do it's fantastic,
"Okay, there 2 reasons why there is 3 stars here. The first is an issue for those of us who want to lock down sensitive data more than just a password, facial recognition, pattern, or finger print. There is no support for a Yubico dongles and other such keys. The 2nd, and not as important, is support for more browser integration. Because of a lack of browsers that it works with, I have to use Chrome and others like it other wise I don't have that ability to utilize APM to its fullest.",
"The application is the best one so far but there are some issues. It is not working properly sometimes on some specific applications. And also, it is popping up at some applicatios that shouldn't do. At ""Steam"" application, it is popping up at chatbox that you send messages to someone else. Could you please fix the issue? Thank you :) addition2: open avira password manager text pops up almost in every nickname and password textboxes but also in Steam app. Android 9 Xiaomi user",
I tried many and many times to change the master password it gives connection error ! Rather than changing the password,
Edit: lowering my rating only because the app has doesn't play well with Firefox. I normally struggle to use the Avira button in Firefox often giving up and taking back to the copy/paste feature for entering credentials I strongly recommend this app to everyone. There is not a person reading this comment that wouldn't benefit from using Avira Password Manager. Works virtually almost perfectly with all of my apps and sites.,
"I had an issue with sign in and syncing passwords between app and browser extension. I emailed them (there is no other way to contact them) and had this reply ""I have checked your email address in our database, and unfortunately I couldn't find any active Avira licenses for this account. Please keep in mind that we can only offer email and telephone support to customers using our premium products."" So unless you buy a license they won't help. I'm ditching for a different app.",
"Great user interface, great security. Autofill that actually works. What more do you want?",
"I really like the idea of this. Sadly, it doesn't do in real life What it does in my head. There's no option to import passwords in the app. I tried logging in to the Web app to see if it was possible there, but it doesn't accept either one of the two passwords required. It won't automatically save any passwords that are autofilled from my browser (firefox) either. I'm not going to be able to commit to copying and pasting every. single. password. into the app - it's just too cumbersome.",
"update. i changed to other password manager , but i keep coming back for this. this is still much better.",
"I am very happy with this password manager, I used a few others before this one.. but I like Avira the best.. the free version here allows me 2 devices connected at the same time.. which is super cool. And the overall user experience is also very smooth. 5 stars would recommend to everyone.",
Excellent free password manager! Works seamlessly across devices and is very convenient for 2FA.,
"Using on Firefox (desktop and mobile) it either doesn't pop up to auto fill at all or there's a very quick Avira pop up that instantly disappears when I tap in the username or password box, either way I always have to navigate away from the browser find avira find the username and password copy them and navigate back to the log in page. It never autofills credit card details either and It also never offers to save new passwords and there's no password generator",
"Avira PWM is the best. I can store unlimited number of passwords, unlike other well known password managers. I can log-in to websites AND apps using Avira. Also it syncs across all my devices. It has a password generator. There are note,too. All this completely free. What more can you ask for? Edit: decreased one star because the notes section is buggy. When I press on any part of a note it scrolls to the top. Makes note editing very difficult. Fix it and it'll be five stars again. All the best.",
"The app is excellent. Had a glitch for around 24 hours, but customer service took care of it.",
"Love the app, but lately it looks up,which is really cumbersome. Since I work in the field of UI/ UX I have detected some small things that could be more consistent and work better. But on average the app is super and I would recommend it to friends.",
I've tested a number of psssword managers and Avira is one of the best. Auto fill and sync works well on both Android and Windows. Unlike other free versions there are no limits to the number of log ins you can store. It also as an authentication module for 2FA to save the need for a separate app. Needs a password generator then it'd be 5 stars.,
"Very useful as password saver and authenticator. It can also be set to autofill apps and webpages with saved accounts. Also generic notes and credit cards can be saved in separate lists, aside from passwords. Would love to see an option for saving accounts linked to say google or facebook, and so having the password field not mandatory; another useful field would be ""account name"", as an optional field between this and email. Thanks for the app.",
"The app is inconsistent. I use it on 3 devices, my phone, tablet & laptop. Works pretty well on the laptop but sketchy on the other 2. It often doesn't fill fields, I have to go into the app to use it or just get the info for the account and enter it myself.",
"Hi. Dear Avira team, help me understand why you are not answering me? I described my problem by email and got a mail from yours with some kind of a service number [7GQ6XE-EE6QM]. I added more info by mail later but still nothing from you.",
Saves the hassle of remembering multiple passwords in a very secure and easy way.,
"This app is great and very user friendly. I do have one problem, when I remove the check mark from Autofill login in forms to disable it, there is no other option for signing in. Was expecting to just click on the user name and password and the information would be applied. Everything I read says autofill big security problem.",
For some reason the app will not offer to save new password or offer to create new passwords it just throws up this annoying pop-up saying there is no password saved for this site. This frustrating pop-up covers the box where you are to type passwords and it pops up every time you refresh.which is kinda the reason why ICanceled my subscription. If it would at least offer to save the new password that you just created then it wouldn't be so bad. But it doesn't. The pc ver works OK though,
"I am using the PRO version and it lacks a lot of features and already has a lot of issues like: a standalone password suggestion like in Kaspersky, poor password management (PW and usernames can't be saved automatically), You can't suggest a password during a registration .. and many more. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",
"It was working perfectly, today it decided not to allow me to sign in via my fingerprint and when it asks for the master password that is not correct either. Same password I've been using since I set up this app. Now I no longer have access to any of my passwords. This is not acceptable. I m scrambling to figure out 85+ personal and business passwords.",
"Avira is hands down the best password app I have used. On most apps after you save a certain number of passwords you have to pay for more but 145+ passwords and still free. There is also a place for secure notes and debit/credit card info. It also has a password generator that allows you to include/exclude uppercase, numbers, special characters and choose length. It also has two-factor authentication for sensitive info apps/websites/email.",
"Not so good. Does not recognize the log in page for several web sites. The passwords generator not always shows up and most of the times it is useless since it doesn't follow the characters allow in each website ergo I end it up creating my own password the majority of times, And sometimes this new password are not saved in the app, you have to enter it manually.... I do not recommend this app at all I think there are much better lotions out there such as dashlane which I will go back soon",
Great little app for storing passwords. Convenient and easy to use. Only minor gripe is that very occasionally (three times over a couple of years) the app wont let me log in and I then have to use the web based version which isn't formatted well for mobile use.,
"I am incredibly grateful that Avira gave us this app to use. It is the best password manager out there without all the bloat functions that come with their competitors. Avira Password Manager is also less than half the price of it's competitors for the premium version. With full zero-knowledge-architecture. Thank you, Avira, for making this world a better place by giving us an amazing free solution too!",
"App is in general okay, but frequently freezes in the login screen and does not let me type my password. This happened on my Galaxy s6 and Fairphone 3. Also, the autocomplete function sometimes appears as an option and sometimes not. I would give it 5 stars if the login and autocomplete function always worked.",
"None of the Avira products are designed to work with Firefox. Browser autofilli service only works for the data hungry Chrome. Avira antivirus also doesn't protect from phishing websites on Firefox. Uninstalled it and I'm very happy with Bitwarden. Because of companies like Avira, the completion in the web browser market is disappearing. They want to support only the leader but not the savior of the open web, only a looser does it. I'm going to get my refund for Prime membership.",
"One of the few best password managers offers strong pw, warns on the strength of the pw, fingerprint unlock makes accessibility easier. In short it's dependable and safe. Auto filling of pw is still a issue and does not happen all the sites. Otherwise would rate it high among the top five.",
Trying out the free tier of Avira PWM at the moment. I cannot say about others but i personally have liked the experience so far. Auto fill works good with Chrome. I'm assuming it will with Edge Chromium too. Separate toggles for app auto fill and browser auto fill is very much appreciated. Suggestions: 1. The phone apps dont seem to have a password generator and I think a password generator should be added. 2. The cost of the pro subscription seems a bit high (considering Bitwarden's price),
"The service is great on my PC...... I'm an avira Prime user and the app temporarily wouldn't let me log in. Seems everyone was affected. Left a review here like everyone else, Avira responded and a day later the issue was fixed! Best of all my 2FA was saved so I didn't loose anything! Thank you Guys, great service!",
"I'm beginning to feel going with Prime was a mistake. There is no advantage to Prime compared to not having it, you are still nickel and dimed for the apps and services Avira claims you have access to. This app is a great example it's telling me to get pro. What a crock.",
"An excellent password generation and management program. The only complaint I have is that it the auto-fill isn't consistently seamless. Maybe once a week I'll have to copy and paste the password ... but overall, this is an excellent tool and moreover because it is free.",
Stopped working on android phone. Cannot log in on app but avira password vault does recognize my credentials on a browser with URL. App fails after displaying a captcha message but never displays a captcha challenge. Server just responds invalid email or password. It was great when it was working and way ahead of some other vault offerings for android. Doesn't appear to have a support option on the avira website.,
Could not find any way to import passwords from another program. This makes it useless. I have 234 passwords stored I am not going to input them one by one. 3-4-22 Thanks for your reply but I've moved on to another app. But why wouldn't there be an import function inside the app itself like every other password manager? Who's gonna know to go to the website to do that?,
"So great! Avira's password manager is a game changer! It performs so well and instantly that the task of having to sign in multiple times each day to accounts or apps which was a tedious chore, interrupting my flow, is now completed in seconds by avira pm! Isn't that the way we want every app and piece of tech to actually, improving our experience and productivity? Thanks Avira, R",
My browser extension is working perfectly. Just my app is weird. I am connected with the same account and I have all the passwords. The problem: they don't load and if they do I see only some weird signs so it is not working properly.,
"Great service ! As a IT geek I really appreciate this service ! It's more safe than actually writing it on a paper and enter the password every time. Because it's easy to log the keyboard without you noticing that at all. This app solves that problem so get it ! German: Großartiger service ! Ich selber bin ausgebildet im IT Bereich und vertraue dieser App all meine Passwörter an. Es verhindert, dass keylogger die das Tastaturfeld dauerhaft scannt und bei dem Hacker als nette Editor Datei ersc.",
This app is terrible compared with Bitwarden which is free. It tells you if your accounts are safe without paying for a subscription. Your app doesn't save password when you change them either. Sometimes it just logs you out for no reason.,
"Great interface and security. However my passwords won't sync between my Macbook and Android device. Would love to change this review if the support team can get in touch, but if the app won't sync then it is essentially pointless",
"I've been using it for ages and its great but suddenly today when I try and log on via my android by the app it keeps trying to bring up a captcha and sends me a code via text but just keeps repeating this, never allowing me to log on until it complains of too many attempts and says try later... Sometimes the captcha shows but most times not, you just see some text re one but no actual captcha.. Now its doing it on the PC..Shows an error 400 which I presume is a page not found..",
"On my phone I show I have 65 p/w, the same as my computer and when I try open all of them it doesn't show anything. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled still the same results. The first time I put it on my phone it worked but somehow it had gotten uninstalled.",
"One of the password managers that is actually good. I switched from Mcafee Truekey as that wasn't working out for me so I decided to look for a new pw manager and this one caught my eye so I tried it out, now its my main pw manager (even for my laptop). Autofill is great, UI is easy to use, Security is strong and it's just 10/10.",
Underrated app with comprehensive free version. My sole qualm is it only provides an autofill service and most Android browsers have really bad autofill API integration. That isn't really Avira's fault but other password managers solve this issue through an additional accessibility service.,
The app randomly signs me out. Like it resets itself. This has happened 3 or 4 times this year. It is incredibly frustrating and inconvenient. I don't understand why. Is otherwise a fairly solid app in my experience.,
Great on a laptop. I like being able to lock the passwords and having to sign-in again as passwords are important enough to warrant constant awareness. The auto filling of log in details on the mobile doesn't always work.,
Installation and registration for this app on my laptop was easy ... But inexplicably the playstore version for Android took forever to download ... The laptop version often makes errors when saving details of multiple accounts from the same provider (eg: gmail) ... So be careful to double-check what exactly is being saved!,
"I can't even login with my Google account. I've uninstalled reinstalled app numerous times to no avail. My 4 star review went down to a 1-star. UPDATE: The latest update has fixed the app. Web version of the app needs to be more mobile friendly, which was what I used in the meantime of not having this app function. Thanks for listening to your reviewers and coming with a swift fix.",
"As a long-time Avira Prime user, for some reason, I appear to have a login issue with Avira Password Manager. I presume this to be a reoccuring problem, because, this is not the first time that I have come to find myself trying to solve it. Is there a known issue thay is same or similar to the one that I described above?",
"I apologize, I can still access my passwords online but my app isn't showing any of them. I jumped the gun a bit, but I freaked over the thought of being locked out of all of my accounts. That's a bad glitch in the app, but all is not lost. I attempted to remove my 1 star review but couldn't figure out how.",
"Password manager not restoring paid subscription of which I have on my PC (Prime) and on mobile via another Avira product I'm not paying 3 times... Edit:- After a few emails I had it sorted, uninstalled app and re-installed the paid version was available, thank you Avira Customer Services!!",
"2.10 have bug,it show prepare your password angin and angin, can't login",
Been locked out by not receiving Verification SMS. And lost all data. No customer support.,
Doesn't work for me as the free version cuts the URLs short the the main domain and extension. As a technician user I have a list of subdomain access with different logins. I contact support by Feedback and that leads to the Google play appstore.,
"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I can't access my password manager because I don't receive the verification code sent to my registered phone number after numerous ""resend code"". There is no alternative means of verification. It is an ongoing issue for 3 days now. My registered phone number is still very much active as I receive calls and messages on it. Avira I need my password manager account back so I can back up my passwords elsewhere.",
"One day I opened the App, and ALL my info was gone",
"Coming from Avira, I had high expectations for this app. It turned out to be a huge disappointment. Has fewer features than others password managers that are free. The UI is nice though.",
It is very useful and really secure. The msot thing I like about this app that it is work on any device you have and sync across all of your devices. Also the free version is more than enough.,
Seems to be getting better and better all the time. Excellent overall service.,
"Paid for subscription, and yet the app says I still need to upgrade to pro...",
Easy to use and works across multiple platforms. It's great.,
"The only app that I need for authentication, for me is not MFA is APM-FA. Maximum qualification.",
"Junk. Different behaviour on every platform, especially terrible on Android managing logins, new accounts and passwords is especially a chore between apps and websites. Choose something else. The iOS version has a good UX Why don't you just replicate that one?",
is the autofill really working? i cant get it to work on browser (samsung internet in s7 edge) i already enabled a lot of thing but there's no luck at all. samsung pass suddenly says I've rooted my device (I didn't root it or anything) and it wont work anymore and i really need some autofill service because it's really pain to type my long äss passwords every time.,
"I have been using the app for a decent amount of time until today where I instantly uninstalled it. It was the one and only place where I saved my info. Today my amazon account ( the hacker decided to get himself a gift card), discord, Facebook, Instagram, and twitter got hacked and my Instagram's password literally got changed in both the app and in the avira ""password manager""app. Anyways, I hope no one faces that where I had to apologise to almost everyone I know. I couldn't rate 0.",
"Good Product, Not compatible with KeePass. It would be great to open a KeePass DB and populate this password manager. No Credit Card option neither. Sophos can do all this but It is in the UK and they are not so strict with Data Protection laws like Germany.",
"Absolutely the best. It's always at my fingertips, secure and easy to use. I love the password generator and being able to individually secure each site.",
Easy to use and encourages me to use properly secure passwords,
"Inconsistent ability to automatically fill in password fields; often need to copy and paste, which is very inconvenient. Also not great at managing multiple userids/passwords per URL, or unique URLs by port number.",
Very capable of storing passwords but the autofill feature just doesn't work even after enabling it in settings. Works fine as a chrome extension on desktop though.,
"APM has stopped syncing on Android. It is forever preparing passwords. Is the issue known and being worked on? EDIT: this has not been fixed, I am now using a different password manager.",
"Updated and I lost everything. Prompted me to login (ignoring that I setup biometrics) and didn't recognize my master password. No way too recover my password with the free version, so I lost all my passwords. Uninstalled.",
Some password may changed if exported and then imported again using csv,
"I absolutely 💕 love this Avira password 🔑 Manager pro app, it's great for saving important passwords and açcount names and also email ✉️ accounts and passwords I would highly recommend getting this I got 30 days for free 🆓 and now I am paying only 2.95 a month to have this and it's worth every penny of mine try it if you don't like it then uninstall it for good, but if you have a lot of passwords and important açcounts you use this is the password manager to definitely to be using 💯 percent",
Doesn't recognise certain apps. Struggles on mobile device to suggest password when signing up. Notes has very little to no functionality (selecting text /editing etc) Thought I had a solution there. Sadly not,
very handy- i like the way it syncs between all my devices and PC's. However on my android smartphone it only auto-enters my passwords about half the time which is a bit annoying.,
Seamless with no issues. Works with all my pc and mobile devices. Better than anything else I've used with very few ads! Thank you so much for making this available.,
"Ok, I rarely give 5* but having used this free suite for a couple of years and Avira A/V on my computers for years, both paid and free, I guess I love both your mobile and computer suites. Always in the top of A/V Comparatives!!!. Thanks for all!",
"I could not get it to fill in a user ID for an app, yet it was able to fill in the password. Autofill for another password manager worked fine. I have posted on the community forum. Waiting for a reply.",
"Password storage, Password strength check, Ease of updating new passwords... Is that what you want? Because it can be yours right now! ... Ya'know, after you tap/click on the download button.",
"Was great until recently update. Now I can no longer add tags. When I make a tag, click the plus icon, go back and they've disappeared. Also, it doesn't even tell you what you get with pro. It literally just says upgrade.",
Works great on my PC & android,
"Avira bloked in Ukraine sms and didn't inform me in time when I have 2FA mode on. I could not login into accound and cancel my subscription, delete my bank card or copy passwords. They couldn't help and continue use my money and private data even after my request to delete my account according GDPR rights.",
I love Avira I have been using avira internet secuity pro for more than 10 years it's always been good I recently purchased Avira optomiser it's as good as Avira internet security pro which I use it on my 2 device I am sure Avira password manager is as good. All Avira products are top shelf don't think 2 times to download them. Thanks Avira for lovely Apps :--),
Best password manager but its loads slow.,
"Seems to be a very good app. I have just installed it. Am wondering if it autofills your passwords if you use it for free, as l can't afford to subscribe at the moment. Just trying it out.",
"I have been using this app for over two months with no problem. However, I am unable to see my saved passwords and the interface is like I never even used the app before.",
"Generates, saves, quality of life is good most places.",
I cannot believe that there is a company so stupid to venture into passwords with a stupid and unusable app. It stopped working without justification and was not even completing the steps to reset the account. Now I am unable to log in to my bank account or any other account.. Disappointing,
This morning I woke up and learned that I can't reach my account because Avira is applying sanctions. It'd be great if at least some warning message was sent. Anyhow by using a cheap VPN I could reach my passwords and delete my account. Hope we won't see each other in future. Thanks for everything...,
Works very best and stable. I liked it.,
"Only 4 stars because one thing I don't like about its feature is it doesn't accept subdomain. Please note that in an organization, there are subdomain websites and each of its sites may have different accounts/credentials.",
Not work after update,
"Your ""FREE"" program is a joke. Sure, you may indicate breaches in safety, but you DO NOT ALLOW US TO SEE THEM WITHOUT PAYING? You are a bunch of scam artists, like most other virus protection programs. If anyone else is reading this, DON'T BOTHER DOWNLOADING. David L",
Great!!! it do very well its works. I will recommend it to anyone who want a reliable password manager. Thanks,
I have been using Avira PWM for two years now and I am very satisfied with this product. I am managing all my passwords with it and the generators for my accounts with 2FA. Adobe PWM is very reliable and adds a lot of security to my accounts. I can only recommend trying it out.,
"It can feel a lil clunky, especially when trying to change passwords to a generate one from the app. This app would benefit the user if it could export the passwords, like you can with Google chrome.",
"web or chrome extension works very well so far. but android mobile app does not recognize or entering to the server. And after few hours, just started working... thnks..",
"From today it stopped working on mobile, but works file in pc. First it shows no password on mobile app, but after trying closing and opening 3/4 times, it has shown passwords but not synching with pc.",
I generally like this app for password. I need to lower my rating because since I switch phone to a pixel3axl I had a few times that I am unable to unlock the master password simply because the keyboard won't pop open.,
"The application worked fine for about 2 months but was soon as I updated it, app my data was gone. Soo bad on your part avira. I thought it to be legit and reliable but it proved a big no.",
"Purchased Avira Prime. PWM never works, every feature you have to download separately. Can't get any help at all. Just a horrible experience.",
Apps of this type used to allow copying an entire entry and duplicating that copy into a new entry. That would be a great feature and a time saver as well.a,
Using it for more than 2 years. Was a paid customer for some time. Very useful and reliable. Works across devices. Has notes and 2FA token feature also!,
Was doing fine up until recently. I checked my passwords on my phone but the app has lost all my passwords and doesn't sync to the desktop version... 😕👎,
Not working on all app. Sometime it just does not show up when one needs ro auto fill cridentials. I feel like its holding me hostage as opposed to being an assistant toake my life easy. Samsung note 20 ultra,
"When adding password, it saves url and name in case sensitive correctly. But when editing a password, it auto convert url and name to normal case, cause problem can not auto fill to app.",
If you don't have have internet your passwords are unaccessible and if you turn off sync it only stores passwords offline and you cannot export them you have to literally write down each and every password by yourself what a waste,
Doesn't let me log in anymore! Liked it when it worked but I will have to switch to Last Pass. I need a PWM that I know will work whenever I need it. Not being able to log in is just not acceptable for a PWM.,
Prob.. resolved. Just a review: It will be better if you add a hand drag drop on the wallet where can reorganize the entries into folders,
Is very simple and works great. Not sure if I can group passwords but I just manually named them in groups. Overall 9/10.,
"Not good at all. Doesn't fill in or ask to save password most of the time, kinda temperamental, and that's the for the premium version.",
"Avira Pro is ABSOLUTELY Every androids users COMPLETE PROTECTION PACKAGE! For ($12 i see believe) the One Year package contains Everything(literally) one will need for complete Conrtole of everything!, &&! 12 months of no Mal,and hacking on the Device ~PER.IOD!~ That's just my opinion on the product. I love it personally im on my 2nd year of 'Avira Pro' -n- wouldn't have it another way! -Sincerely: Aaron Sanders. Avira give me promos A/O Cupons PLZ",
When logging in sometimes. It shows I have ZERO data/passwords. Stopped recognising my Master Password. doesn't let me change it after loging in with biometric credentials. And now I cannot use my passwords on any other device.,
"Lately it doesn't synchronize the passwords that I save in my browser to the Android app, I add them on the web and it doesn't show in the app... Help!",
What personal data you need. I not subscribed. Is free version I am using. Doesn't work on S10 Plus mobile. Works on Samsung Galaxy S7 tho. It only is Android 8. S10 Plus is now update to Android 11. See what I mean? Should work on Android 11 too.,
"Best PM So Far, just want to let you know if the app crashes when you try to enter you master pass. Just force stop, clear app cache and data then try logging in. It worked for me",
Up until the latest release I enjoyed using this app however I can no longer sign in to my account using it. Everytime I try I keep getting an error message below the email field that says INVALID EMAIL FORMAT. My email address hasn't changed,
"Kindly inform me, Avira password manager all features is absolutely free for users? Have any hidden charges for free user? Otherwise your password manager features is very helpful. Browser extension not work properly.",
"No longer works on Android 10. I can login using fingerprint, but I can't login thru typing master password, I can't click on Menu Bar, Authentication and other features",
useful but the web interface is slow to load and the autofill option on mobile tends to get in the way rather than help.,
"Good, as a password manager, but just noticed a small flaw, cannot distinguish between a zero 0 and a capital O, would be easy to correct.",
"Completely non functioning, the beta version will just tell me there is no Internet connection, release version will tell you there is something wrong. Can't even login to submit diagnostic data.",
"I find this password manager works flawlessly, better than lasspass.. would recommend you try it out and see if it does what you want it to do.... for me definitely worth the five stars.",
"Great. A pattern lock would be good. It only uses biometric and the actual password, no option for pattern password.",
"Have tried numerous other password managers, this is hands down the very best! Easy to set up and works flawlessly every time!",
I cannot access to my own account. It says connecting to google and stops working. All my credentials are locked inside.,
Constantly having problems. It won't let me log in to get my passwords that I require to use this isn't the first time very frustrated.,
Very good. I like the auto fill. Only problem is that you have to manually add the passwords rather than them asking to add it.,
Really useful when working between os and different computers. Avira showing how to make technology useful rather then stressful. Thanks,
Was really great when it worked but lately it constantly crashes and doesn't seemy to be syncing passwords.,
"good app. one of the improvement what I expect is, manual sync button because I don't know whether it is already sync with web site or not",
"Great App but it seems to log me out intermittently so i find myself having to log back in to it way too frequently, which is inconvenient.",
"Easy to use, simple and clean interface, device interconnection. Great program.",
"Nice password wallet. It sometimes is a bit reluctant to pop-up when entering a login page, especially with Firefox.",
"I really like using this app, but I could do without the notification every 15 seconds telling me the service is enabled. Please fix that",
"Great way to generate and store passwords. A bit glitchy on Android phone with Auto log-in using firefox browser, Chrome fine.",
"I've been using this for close to a year now and the last time I got on all my passwords were completely gone. Must have been a glitch or something, because it says I haven't made any passwords yet.",
"Great password manager and safekeeping of important notes, also has a swift autofill function that works well on all platforms.",
"What is going on with your app? All my passwords reverted back to my previous ones, and l had to reset every one. I have unsubscribed. Disgraceful!",
"I would like a 2 step verification to the avira account through QR code to log in option, option to import/export selected passwords to move to different accounts of password managers, offline password manager option, pin to unlock option !. thank you!",
"Great, don't have to worry about remembering passwords again.",
"Idk whats going on, many of my saved noted are not appearing, if i create a new one, the old one appears the. The new one disappears.",
I don't know what is going on with this app. I can't login with my phone but I can log in with dextop..is this a bug or anything . Please resolve this issue.,
Having used LastPass for 7 years APM although not functionally as rich offers a far simpler interface and meets my needs entirely to store 400+ passwords.,
"WORKS PERFECTLY.... VERY VERY Convinent and safe to use... Makes getring around your browser and phone faster and easier and most of all, still keeping its safe...",
They should improve the stability how to be checked to collect the passwords in order as you needed all the time to log in back in the app ;( this take time huh,
It looks nice and its easy to use but it doesnt sync your data on multiple devices.,
Easy to use and responsive.,
"Excellent in almost everything, but their support for subdomains passwords is painful, please try to make it more neat and simple to use",
Logged out of my account now everytime I try and login again it keeps sending the code to my old phone number if you can contact me to solve this issue then I might give it a better rating,
"Super slow and buggy when you have 1400+ passwords and counting, even on Pro version. Disappointed as a Prime customer",
"Great tool! Could use more flexible ways of passwords creation, like only uppercase or just numbers.",
"Avira password manager has been a time-saver, a brain-saver and of course, very secure. A great product!",
Not getting verification SMS In Bangladesh. Please fix this,
Sometimes irritating banner appears at the bottom of the screen for infinite number of times. (Avira password manager service enabled ) 😭,
Syncs between laptop and mobile. And is easy to use. Perfect.,
There is a problem with the app where I have to give it access to use it on my browser every time I need a password it's very annoying please fix this,
"Excellent app for generating, storing and auto filling passwords. Best one I've used so far.",
"Absolutely useful for creating a strong unique password that hackers are difficult to guess by those, top accounts are Google, FB, Twitter and more. With password manager can auto fill when ever I sign in. Thanks Avira 👍👍👍👍👍 Vielen Dank ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",
Beat free password manager with good paid features. The auto fill is reliable compared to the competition.,
Interface looks kinda washed out. Auto fill not the best out there but does the job. No TOTP on pc? Which is a bummer,
Useful app! No more remembering passwords though sometimes you would have to remember to add in those passwords.,
Keeps telling me that my internet connection is no there when I am using my phone for all the other apps.,
Secure and easy to use password manager. Now you can forget about using same passwords across to multiple accounts...,
Cannot add new login data from click new popup auto fills when the app not yet registered. Must input new data before it. Not like other password manager.,
love it update: still going strong its necessary.,
I can't sign in. it's froze on the master password screen. I can't do anything! What have you done with your app!?,
Amazing password manager. Does everything I need and does it well. I especially like that it has 2fa.,
Feature Request: Allow to import passwords from a CSV file. Chrome allows you to export passwords in CSV format. Can you ads this feature to read this file and import all passwords in one go?,
"This is the best password keeper in my own view, Lastpass is good APM is the best, they have the best encryption ever.",
I enter correct master password but it doesn't work. It says I entered the wrong master password.,
Cannot login. Not sending SMS OTP. Your 2FA is useless.,
It crashes my os whenever i use it on walmart app. Please fix it. Android 8.0.0 stock version.,
Deactivate the app on the phone without any notification. I don't even have access to my personal information,
A real time saver. Best experience with a password manager. Great work team.,
No way to revoke 2FA. You will lost all your passwords forever because avira will fail to send you verification sms,
"Updated: Used to love all Avira apps but pwm has been having so many loading issues recently, I'm moving to another password manager.",
Really appreciate this apps abilities and protection. Seems much less intrusive than other major security apps.,
"Doesn't open and keeps on crashing , all my important passwords are inaccessible to me now.",
"hi, it would be great that once we on web protection and PWM it should be on unless we off so i think it would be great. thanks",
"My issue was resolved quickly, the app works great now. It truly is a lifesaver!!!!",
One of the best and easiest password manager. No problems for over six months!,
I am using this service or app since 2019.I facing the automatic logout issue since 2019.I am still waiting for solution.Please i request @Avira team to solve the issue in next update.,
"Does not work offline, no option to force the password prompt to show, same goes for the password generator",
"It's working pretty good, but unfortunately does not update well between the app and the website",
Constantly will not pop up in apps or webpages to allow me to autofill have to open avira app login then copy passwords.,
Very helpful in the time you are surfing through internet without any tansion of remembering passwords.,
Nice password manager but does not offer any option to save password like bitwarden..please add this feature,
"Very nicely Done AVIRA. But I don't have money for your PRO version, uninstalling now.",
"Even though I am a Prime member with Password Pro subscription, the app doesn't recognises the license.",
"I love the manager it helps me so much to remember so many things that I have forgotten from different site I have registered before it is a nice one, a note book with a password",
Efficient and user friendly. I also use it on my Windows 10 devices.,
After initial glitch getting pro to register was resolved I have uprated to 5*. Great free app and the pro app is even better,
"Easy to use and organized very well. Love using this everyday, thank you!",
"The program is very nice, but if the Arabic language was added, it would be more beautiful",
"It was 5 * before I tried to contact support. And got an answer, that only paid products get the support. So make your own conclusions about this company and their attitude.",
Sweet app that is connected across the board. As I have 4 driod tablets 2 iPads and an S7.,
"Everything good, just that I'm on android 8.0 and I would love a dark mode for the App!! Please work that devs! Cheers",
a suggestion for your good app: we want add attach file to some website profiles and categorize them.,
This is awesome. I like it very much. It save my passwords and it is 101% secure. I give 5 out of 5 star,
After Last update unable to login.. Wrong email or password.. Please rectify.. Im login before update but after app itself required login again,
I love Avira password vault and it do what it suppose to do. It is simple but strong,
It is constantly making me sign in with both passwords in order to fill a password on another app.,
"Too bright, makes reading difficult. Needs some themes fast.",
I'm using Avira since more than 25 years and never had any problems with virus,
A must have app in everyone's phone. Very handy and easy to use.,
Best free password manager. Perfectly works both web and mobile.,
would be great if the screen didnt freeze everytime I open the app....,
"Great password manager, only one you can use free on more devices !!!",
I greatly recommend. They even have chrome extension. Plus online web admin interface,
Total nightmare. Cannot cope with multiple devices,
If PWM would only sync between my devices I would give you 5 stars. If it does I can't find it,
worst app...totally worthless... saved my very important note and it gets vanished the other day...seriously..the app is a bad joke!!!,
"The most robust password manager I have used, and I've tried them all.",
Very good app its easy to get a new password if you forget your old one,
"Why can't I log in, on and off have this kind of problem, really annoying.",
I bought the basic version because I stream regularly and it has been the best security I've had so far,
"Fantastic, does what it claims and the note section is very helpful",
Effective in storing protected passwords and protected notes across multiple devices,
"Excellent, love having everything at the push of a button.",
it is a nice app... but doesn't work with Bing and Edge browser...,
since year's the best antivirus software! l use it since 1978!,
"They lost all of my passwords this morning and I cant reach customer service. If I have to write my passwords down and keep them some place safe, then why am I paying for this service?",
It's so nice to have a fully functional password manager as a free version <3,
Rubbish this is. Doesn't autofill passwords for Google accounts.,
Autofill is not working even after giving all the permission,
Brilliant. The built in authenticator is useful too.,
Sort of kind of works Rob forn is better,
Worked great until yesterday and I opened it up to find all my passwords gone,
"JUST STARTED USING IT A FEW WEEKS AGO, BUT SO FAR SO GOOD. EASY TO USE AND I LOVE THE APP LOCK!!",
Excellent app to store all username and passwords.,
App works well. Easy and quick to use.,
Easy to use just like the browser page.,
I just down loaded this app on my phone can the app be downloaded onto my desktop/laptop as well? can't seem to download on computer,
Excelent app apart from inap adds i am paying for premium service .,
Great potential bu extremely difficult to navigate the horrendous complexity.,
Not working .. In pc version when i sign in to account automatically sign out ✅😒,
Life changing how helpful this app is -especially across platforms!,
Nice password manager easy look and comfortable using,
"I like all avira product. Simple, work great!",
"Best UI, UX, UE. keep it up!",
If accidentally deleted any password. It is getting permanently deleted instead of going to recycle bin,
Super easy. Much better than Lastpass.,
Why I Don't Get Loging otp Code...?,
It makes everything easy I've never heard of this app before my computer guy rebuilt my laptop,
"Love the app, this is exactly what I needed. Would kove to work with you guys.",
Cannot login into mobile devices. Poor app.,
"easy to use , secure and fast!",
Great at auto fill. No problems so far,
More than two years using this password manager and there is nothing I can complain about. It does what it has to do.,
Easy to use and intuitive. Very handy.,
"Extremely effective and easy to use, love it",
Works perfectly nowadays :) totally saves me from the regular password hassle,
2 hr fight reset logout restart both laptop and phone still not recognising email or password.,
App not working can not login or can not add passwords,
Makes my access seamless between multiple devices.,
Works well. Don't screw it up!,
Hassle free service,
"It does what it promises, and with so many passwords it is a tool you need these days",
Beautiful app. Only more discount needed.,
Works well. Could use a little tweaking,
Using it for 4 yrs and is seamless between all my systems and phones,
"Everything is good on web app, but mobile app i cant login.",
Probably the best actually usable free password manager.,
"The best LastPass alternative, hands down..",
I'm sick and tired of APM logging me out completely for no reason.,
"Great app. It's like Google password manager, but better.",
Very useful app. Please add PIN code for app login,
No custom fields. Prefer one time payment for a lifetime.,
simple and user friendly,
Data is not visible after update,
"Very good app, for maintain secured the passwords",
"Good. However, two step verification (Authenticator) should be available.",
"I cannot login into mobile. Same account i used from pc. I use yahoo mail. Pc ok, Mobile Not. Please advice.",
Updated to four stars after broken app was fixed.,
Seems not working fine with Xiaomi 12T PRO,
Doesn't let you contact customer service unless you pay.,
This is the best password manager! it stores sites in alpha order.. I Love it!,
I was looking for this app for a long time & finnaly i got it. It's so useful app & it's free...!,
So far satified with the many ablities of the app will provide a full review in the near future .,
I haven't used it yet but I see you guys responded with thank you for your positive feedback to a negative review! Do you even read your reviews? Not a good start!,
Very Disappointing You Cannot Trust This App If You Forgot Your Master Password Then You Cannot Reset It Your All Passwords Will Be Deleted,
Google chrome extension doesn't sync with mobile app.,
Not the most user friendly and support are terrible,
Useful app to store and create strong passwords,
This is a great free password manager that I'd recommend.,
App has been improving. Get easier to use.,
"Yes it's still not sure how much it is and why I came here, get up & run quickly",
Easy to use for password management,
I like it still using the free features and I'm so satisfied 😌,
Efficient and useful.,
Perfect. Very easy to use.,

"Works great, easy to use.",
Unable to login,
"Simple to use, very effective",
one of the best password manager apps that i have been used..,
Easy and secure,
"Really good,safe protection!",
Very easy to maneuver around.,
Great security system!,
Iam using it for almost a year and works fine and recommended to some friends also,
It's an excellent 👌 product. So far so good 👍. Recommended...,
I prefer no password for one-time password section,
"I put my pwd in the app ,but now all pwd are deleted automatically..",
I gave THIS A rateing because It does show me how to import my Last Pass data,
Great free option!,
"The website access does not stay on, therefore I have to keep setting it.",
"From an usability standpoint this might be a decent solution : have a central repository from which to get your passwords. From a privacy standpoint, using them is suicide. The next time the governmental organisations ask, or some disgruntled employee wants to shame them, or Russian hackers hack in, or some tired system administrator publicly exposes a whole database to the Internet, or 1000 other cases your data will be readily available to anyone who happens to know where to look.",
Wowo very use full apps 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰,
Such a great app! I am really a fan of AVIRA NOW!!!!,
Not as good as it used to be,
Best password manager ever i seen in my life keep it up to develop software for us,

"The best free password manager, ever !",
I trust this antivirus and password manager and use it on all my devices because of synchronisation,
It is an excellent password manager I have ever used. Auto fill feature perfectly working on my android device.its just awesome,
Its weight work in RAM and the icon / logo of the web is not shown.,
"Easy to use, great syncing, great ui, no adds, free. Amazing.",
Very good app,
"Best app ever i have seen ,,, highly recommend to you because this is the best,,.....",
The application don't open Can you help me?,
I have to reinstall the app to sync any changes in my my browser!,
Now I don't have to remember my passwords again!,
Why has malware,
My master password works on google chrome on my pc but does not work on my android device? Is this a bug?,
Thanks.Very efficient app.,
I love this app but how can I change my master pw?,
how can i recovery my master password? hellp me. thanks,
great app that makes login very easy. Expecting more and more functionalities in the future,
"Not all passwords are for internet sites so I cant understand, why each password u put in has to have a web address?!",
It never worked,
Likeing it thank you,
Great,
After update is not working anymore...keep pop up then gone. .its not stable apps,
"I just paid for the pro, I wanted to use the password manager, I try to log in and always come the info that email address is not correct. .. make me crazy...",
Have to uninstall it if I want to fill out certain forms devoid of passwords!,
"I am very happy​ with this app. However, can it be hacked if someone steals my phone?",
"Will not open with my Avira Account email and password. Try to register and it says the email is already registered. Tried many times, done.",
"A world-class password app, especially if you are also using Avira Connect dashboard.",
Good,
Registering a new Avira account using this app could effectively avoid the password complexity requirements...,
"Does Not Support Device Encryption. I don't care what excuse is used, an App for a security purpose should never effect device encryption. Will not allow screen lock/start up password. Completely pointless.",
"Just OK,But sometimes too late.",
Good,
I never gonna forget a password again with this app it is really helpful specialy for those who have different password on different accounts i'm so thankful.,
Seems a work in progress as doesn't seem to integrate with Firefox on android. Works fine with Firefox on Windows though. Hopefully an update is coming as seems pretty slick otherwise.,
Just started using it. Have used avira antivirus for a decade.i am a fan of avira. deducted one star as it doesn't have fingerprint unlock,
"Always dreaded re-entering my email and passwords in multiple sites over and over again, it's now so much more convenient with this app!",
Give me a chance to use it please.,
Must now this kind of app and avira is the best just install n done Please can you ad safe note this is my opinion if there it is very helpful other ways you are the best,
